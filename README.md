AI Document Customizer 
(Building right now 🚧)

A smart text-editing SaaS for everyday documents, job applications, and customer support workflows.

This AI-powered web app — built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase, and Grok LLaMA 3.3 — helps users instantly generate customized versions of any document.

Instead of rewriting the same text repeatedly, users upload one master document, highlight the sections they want AI to modify, add target contexts and receive perfectly tailored variations — all while preserving the original document’s structure.
